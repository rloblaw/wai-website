This document describes how user agents determine the names and descriptions of accessible objects, where information comprising that name can come from various characteristics of the content, in order to lead to a consistent result across implementations. The document previously included Accessibility API Mappings, which have been moved to Core Accessibility API Mappings, so this document only describes the procedure to determine accessible name and description, not how to expose it.
